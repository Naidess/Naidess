### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Fernando ServiÃ¡n
#### Development
I am pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I am expanding my knowledge in back-end development, and I also enjoy software development, especially when it's something useful that makes life easier.
In the future, I want to delve deeper into cloud computing and Big Data, as Iâ€™m fascinated by how they enable scalable, data-driven applications and can help businesses make informed decisions.

Skills: Python/PL/SQL/Java 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript and Node.Js 
- âš¡ Fun fact: Outside of coding, I love gaming and hiking
